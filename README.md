## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
1. Youtube
   -I like how it gives recommened videos on what you've been watching
   -When you just open the app if gives you an animation
   -How do vidoes plays without clicking on it
2.Snapchat
    -How everyone can chat and make groupchats to talk
    -How you can add others as friends
   -How it has the face animation where the camera recoginze your face
3.My Amex App
    -Shows you how much credit you have used it
   -Updates when you make a purchase or oay
   -Shows you special offers exculisive to amex card holders
4.Weather App
    -Shows you the weather in your area
   -Can type in different locations around the world and shows you the weather in that area

The app I would like to build a weather app but have an improvement where it has the weather aspect but I would like a way to show news or article reports regarding that area so people can have insight on whats going around the world. A Lot of people base thier outfit or day on how the weather is going to be. Since not many people watch the news anymore it is important to stay up to date with news around the world.

## Notes

I had trouble when I had to change the color of the text. I Though IBOutlet you can make have an action but yu have to write the code in IBAction for it to have an action.
